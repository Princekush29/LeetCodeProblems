How does Selenium scroll a webpage both horizontally and vertically?

In Selenium, you can use the JavaScript Executor to scroll a web page both horizontally and vertically. However, the JavaScript Executor does not have the method to scroll a web page both horizontally and vertically. It has the method ‚ÄúscrollBy‚Äù and ‚ÄúscrollTo‚Äù which can scroll the page horizontally or vertically.

In order to scroll the page both horizontally and vertically, you need to use the ‚ÄúscrollBy‚Äù method twice in a row, once for horizontal scrolling and once for vertical scrolling. Here is an example of how to use the ‚ÄúscrollBy‚Äù method to scroll a web page both horizontally and vertically in Selenium: 

JavaScriptexecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;
js.executeScript(‚Äúwindow.scrollBy(3000,0)‚Äù); //Horizontal scroll</p>
js.executeScript(‚Äúwindow.scrollBy(0,3000)‚Äù); //Vertical Scroll

How do I scroll down using sendKeys in selenium?
In Selenium, you can use the sendKeys() method to simulate key presses, including the ‚ÄúPage Down‚Äù key. To scroll down using sendKeys(), you can use the following code:

action.sendKeys(Keys.PAGE_DOWN).build().perform();

This will simulate a ‚ÄúPage Down‚Äù key press on the element, which will scroll the element down.
