Question 59 Why Xpath is better than CSS selector?

#interviewquestions #interviewtips

👉 XPath allows bidirectional flow.

👉 Using an XPath, we can traverse both ways, i.e., from parent to child and child to parent, which is not possible in CSS.

👉 XPath is a more versatile and powerful choice for data extraction in sites with complex layouts or non-HTML data.

👉 Instead, CSS selectors are simpler and more intuitive, which makes them better suited for straightforward element selection tasks in HTML documents.
