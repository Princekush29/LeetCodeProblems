/*
 * Java evaluates the entire expression before passing it to System.out.print.
 * That means: - "Hello" + " " is fine. - But 1 / 0 triggers an
 * ArithmeticException before any part of the string is printed. ðŸ§  Key Insight:
 * - The exception is thrown during expression evaluation, not during the actual
 * print call. - So System.out.print(...) never gets a chance to execute. -
 * Control jumps directly to the catch block, which prints "World".
