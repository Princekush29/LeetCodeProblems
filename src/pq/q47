#interviewquestions #interviewtips

👨💻 Queue Interface

👉 Queue interface orders the element in FIFO (First In First Out) manner. In FIFO, first element is removed first and last element is removed at last.

👉 It can be defined as an ordered list that is used to hold the elements which are about to be processed.

👉 There are various classes like PriorityQueue, Deque, and ArrayDeque which implements the Queue interface.

👉 The Java Queue provides support for all of the methods of the Collection interface including deletion, insertion, etc.

👉 PriorityQueue, ArrayBlockingQueue and LinkedList are the implementations that are used most frequently.

👉 The NullPointerException is raised, if any null operation is done on the BlockingQueues.

Queue interface can be instantiated as:
1.	Queue<String> q1 = new PriorityQueue();  
2.	Queue<String> q2 = new ArrayDeque();
