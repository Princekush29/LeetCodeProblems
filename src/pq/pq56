Question 55 Why multiple inheritance is not supported in java?

#interviewquestions #interviewtips

👉 To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, multiple inheritances are not supported in java.

👉 Consider a scenario where A, B, and C are three classes. The C class inherits A and B classes. If A and B classes have the same method and you call it from child class object, there will be ambiguity to call the method of A or B class.

👉 Since compile-time errors are better than runtime errors, Java renders compile-time error if you inherit 2 classes.

👉 So whether you have same method or different, there will be compile time error.
