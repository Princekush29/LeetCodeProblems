Question 55 How to upload a file in Selenium WebDriver?

#interviewquestions #interviewtips

There are multiple ways to handle file upload in Selenium:

👉 Using sendKeys method
👉 Using AutoIT tool
👉 With the help of Robot Class

👨💻 Method 1
WebElement upload_file = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[@id='file_up']"));
upload_file.sendKeys("C:/Users /Desktop/upload.png");

👨💻 Method 2
Runtime.getRuntime().exec(“C:\\Users\\Chait\\Desktop\\autoit\\fileupload.exe”);
Runtime: It allows the script to interface with the environment in which the script is running.
getRuntime(): It is used to get the current runtime associated with the process.
exec(): It executes the AutoIT script (here, which is fileupload.exe).

👨💻 Method 3
// creating object of Robot class
     Robot rb = new Robot()

// press Contol+V for pasting
     rb.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_CONTROL);
     rb.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_V);
 
// release Contol+V for pasting
    rb.keyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_CONTROL);
    rb.keyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_V);
 
// for pressing and releasing Enter
    rb.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_ENTER);
    rb.keyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_ENTER);
