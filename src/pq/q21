Question 21 Difference between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions in Java?

#interviewquestions #interviewtips

👉 Checked Exception
🚀 The classes that directly inherit the Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions e.g. IOException, SQLException etc. 
🚀 Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.
🚀 In checked exceptions, there are two types: fully checked and partially checked exceptions. 
🚀 A fully checked exception is a checked exception where all its child classes are also checked, like IOException, and InterruptedException. 
🚀 A partially checked exception is a checked exception where some of its child classes are unchecked, like an Exception.

👉 Unchecked Exception
🚀 The classes which inherit RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions e.g. ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException etc. 
🚀 Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time, but they are checked at runtime.
🚀 In short unchecked exceptions are runtime exceptions that are not required to be caught or declared in a throws clause. 
🚀 These exceptions are usually caused by programming errors, such as attempting to access an index out of bounds in an array or attempting to divide by zero.
🚀 Unchecked exceptions include all subclasses of the RuntimeException class, as well as the Error class and its subclasses.
